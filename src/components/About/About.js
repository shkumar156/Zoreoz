            Hello! My name is <strong>Daniyal Rao</strong>. I'm originally from Multan, Pakistan and have been living in Abbottabad, Pakistan for the past three years.

            My journey into the world of technology began with a strong passion for problem-solving, which led me to pursue the Computer Systems Technology program. Despite its challenges, I remained determined and forged lasting friendships that supported me throughout this demanding program.
            Throughout my studies at BSCS, I had the opportunity to engage in fascinating projects. Notably, I contributed to the development of the React Applications, projects that garnered recognition from my colleagues, instructors, and clients alike.
